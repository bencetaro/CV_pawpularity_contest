# Pawpularity Contest
This notebook was made for a contest I participated in 2022 january.
(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/petfinder-pawpularity-score)

The goal of the competition was to improve a tool used for ranking pictures of pets, by helping the adaptation process of these animals. The images had a corresponding "pawpularity score" based on the pet profile's page view statistics. This score and other tabular information were the reference to train the network.
